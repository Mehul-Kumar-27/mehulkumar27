### 🚀 Ready-to-Deploy Portfolio Website  

Building a portfolio can be a hassle when you have to update your name, projects, and personal details scattered across multiple files. This project simplifies that process, allowing you to make all your customizations in a single place.  

🛠️ **Quick Setup:**  
1. Edit the `src/config/home.json` file with your personal details.  
2. Run `npm start` to start the website.  

The rest of the website will automatically adapt to your changes. No more hunting through the codebase – just one file and you're good to go!
